My current portfolio website at [joelwickstrom.com](https://joelwickstrom.com)

This website was built with Next.js and uses Sanity.io for headless cms. It is hosted on fly.io.
Site analytics is integrated to [umami]([https://umami-one-theta.vercel.app/dashboard](https://umami.is/)) for basic analytics.

In progress...
