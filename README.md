This is my current portfolio website: [joelwickstrom.com](https://joelwickstrom.com)

This version was built with Next.js and uses Sanity.io for headless cms. Website is hosted on fly.io.
Libraries such as GSAP, Three.js and Tailwind are used for playing around with the UI.

I will continue editing this website whenever I get new inspirations and ideas.

Site analytics is integrated to [umami]([https://umami-one-theta.vercel.app/dashboard](https://umami.is/))
